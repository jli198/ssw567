<h2>Requirements Statement for Example ATM System</h2>

<p>
The software to be designed will control a simulated automated teller machine (ATM)
having a magnetic stripe reader for reading an ATM card, a customer console (keyboard and
display) for interaction with the customer, a slot for depositing envelopes, a dispenser 
for cash (in multiples of $20), a printer for printing customer receipts, and
a key-operated switch to allow an operator to start or stop the machine.  The ATM
will communicate with the bank's computer over an appropriate communication link.
(The software on the latter is not part of the requirements for this problem.)
</p>

<p>
The ATM will service one customer at a time.  A customer will be required to 
insert an ATM card and enter a personal identification number (PIN) - both of
which will be sent to the bank for validation as part of each transaction.  The
customer will then be able to perform one or more transactions.  The card will be 
retained in the machine until the customer indicates that he/she desires no 
further transactions, at which point it will be returned - except as noted below.
</p>

<p>
The ATM must be able to provide the following services to the customer:
</p>

<ol>
<li> A customer must be able to make a cash withdrawal from any suitable account
   linked to the card, in multiples of $20.00.  Approval must be obtained from 
   the bank before cash is dispensed.
</li>
<li> A customer must be able to make a deposit to any account linked to the card,
   consisting of cash and/or checks in an envelope.  The customer will enter
   the amount of the deposit into the ATM, subject to manual verification when
   the envelope is removed from the machine by an operator.  Approval must be
   obtained from the bank before physically accepting the envelope.  
</li>
<li> A customer must be able to make a transfer of money between any two accounts
   linked to the card.
</li>
<li> A customer must be able to make a balance inquiry of any account linked to
   the card.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
A customer must be able to abort a transaction in progress by pressing the Cancel
key instead of responding to a request from the machine.
</p>

<p>
The ATM will communicate each transaction to the bank and obtain verification
that it was allowed by the bank.  Ordinarily, a transaction will be considered
complete by the bank once it has been approved.  In the case of a deposit, a
second message will be sent to the bank indicating that the customer has
deposited the envelope.  (If the customer fails to deposit the envelope within
the timeout period, or presses cancel instead, no second message will be sent to
the bank and the deposit will not be credited to the customer.)
</p>

<p>
If the bank determines that the customer's PIN is invalid, the customer will be
required to re-enter the PIN before a transaction can proceed.  If the customer
is unable to successfully enter the PIN after three tries, the card will be
permanently retained by the machine, and the customer will have to contact the
bank to get it back.  
</p>

<p>
If a transaction fails for any reason other than an invalid PIN, the ATM will 
display an explanation of the problem, and will then ask the customer whether
he/she wants to do another transaction.
</p>

<p>
The ATM will provide the customer with a printed receipt for each successful 
transaction, showing the date, time, machine location, type of transaction, 
account(s), amount, and ending and available balance(s) of the affected account 
("to" account for transfers).
</p>

<p>
The ATM will have a key-operated switch that will allow an operator to start and stop
the servicing of customers.  After turning the switch to the "on" position, the operator
will be required to verify and enter the total cash on hand.  The machine can only be
turned off when it is not servicing a customer. When the switch is moved to the "off"
position,  the machine will shut down, so that the operator may remove deposit envelopes
and reload the machine with cash, blank receipts, etc.
</p>

<p>
The ATM will also maintain an internal log of transactions to facilitate resolving
ambiguities arising from a hardware failure in the middle of a transaction.
Entries will be made in the log when the ATM is started up and shut down,
for each message sent to the Bank (along with the response back, if one is expected),
for the dispensing
of cash, and for the receiving of an envelope.  Log entries may contain card
numbers and dollar amounts, but for security will <em>never</em> contain a PIN.
