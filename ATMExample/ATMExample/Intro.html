<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h3>What you will Find Here</h3>

<p>
This page is the starting point into a series of pages that attempt to give a
complete example of object-oriented analysis, design, and programming applied to
a moderate size problem: the simulation of an Automated Teller Machine.  I developed
these pages in the belief that students would benefit from seeing a <em>complete
</em> example of OO methodology applied to a single problem.  Since then, I have
developed a similar-style solution to an even simpler problem: 
<a href="http://www.cs.gordon.edu/courses/cs211/AddressBookExample/index.html"
target="_top">maintaining a <em>very</em> simple address book</a>.

</p>

<p>
Beginning with a statement of requirements, the process proceeds through analysis,
overall design, and detailed design and implementation, culminating with some
suggestions for maintenance.  (Testing is left as an exercise to the reader :-).) 
</p>

<p>
Analysis is done by identifying the use cases and detailing a flow of events for each.
Also, an initial set of functional test cases is specified, to serve as a vehicle for
checking that the implementation is complete and basically correct.
Analysis culminates in identifying classes implied by the use cases, and documenting 
them using an Analysis Class Diagram.
(The Statechart diagrams done under design are also, in part, analysis tasks.
In OO, the line between analysis and design is not always a sharp one.)
</p>
<p>
Overall design begins by using CRC cards to assign responsibilities to the
various classes.  The static structure of the design is summarized by means
of an overall Class Diagram.  Then the dynamic aspects of the design are
developed, using State Charts for the major controller classes, plus an Interaction Diagram
for each of the main use cases.  
</p>
<p>  
The detailed design is developed by spelling out the attributes and methods for each
class, using a class diagram for each class with all three "compartments" fully
filled in.   A package diagram is used to show how the various classes are groupled
into packages.  Each class is then implemented in Java.  The code page contains links both to
Javadoc documentation for each class, and to the complete source code.  Also included
are a main class, which allows the simulation to run as an application, and an Applet
class, which allows it to be run as an Applet.  (This illustrates how the same basic
code can be designed to be used either way; the application was used for most of
the initial development work, but the Applet is accessible to anyone over the web).
</p>
<p>  
The Executable Applet version can be loaded and executed 
from within any web browser that supports at least JDK 1.1.x.
</p>
<p>
The Maintenance page discusses ideas for possible changes to the system, each of
which would require changes to multiple documents, not just the code.
</p>


<h3>Background</h3>

<p>
This is the second significant revision of this series of pages.
</p>
<ol>
<li>I originally developed this series of pages for use in a course which was taught to
junior CS majors at Gordon College from 1996 to 1999, using C++.  (That version is available 
<a href="../../cs320/ATM_Example/index.html">here</a> - from which you can
follow a link to an even older version if you wish.)</li>
<li>The second version represents a major revision (done during 2000 and 2001) for use in 
<a href="../index.html"> "Object-Oriented Software Development"</a>,
which is taught to sophmore CS majors and uses Java.  The most
signficant change in the second and subsequent versions is the use of UML notation
throughout, together with a reorganization of the process to more closely follow the UML approach.
Moreover, the original version was implemented in both C++ and Java; but subsequent
versions uses only Java, so as to be able to utilize some features of that language 
(e.g. threads) which have no direct analog in the C++ language per se.  That version is
available <a href = "../ATMExample2001/index.html">here</a>. </li>
<li>I more recently (in 2002) revised the sequencing of the pages to reflect a slightly 
different ordering of the steps in the software development process as I am now teaching
it in 2002.  (The content of the current set of pages is almost exactly the same as the 
2000-2001 version, but the order is different.)</li>
</ol>

<p>
The original version followed the design methodology taught in the textbook I used
in the earlier course - [Horstmann, 1997], and some aspects of that
approach remain.    For second and subsequent versions, I have
used a simplified version of the process outlined in [Jacobson, Booch, and Rumbaugh, 1999].
</p>
<p>
It may be argued that more diagrams have been used than are really necessary for
a project of this size.  I wanted to give as complete an example of using the
various UML diagrams as possible.  Even so, this example does not include any
activity, component, or deployment diagrams.
</p>

<h3>Using these Pages</h3>

<p>
Probably the best way to start using these pages is to first read the requirements,
and then work through the entire analysis, design, and implementation process.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>
Begin with the Statement of Requirements 
and then view the Use Cases.  The Use Case document has a Use Case Diagram and
a series of flows of events, one for each use case.  The analysis phase can be
studied both in terms of the "big picture" and in terms of the details of the 
use cases.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Before studying the flows of events
in detail, it might be helpful to look at the diagram showing the Analysis classes
to get an overall view of the system implicit in the use cases.  The
Analysis Class Diagram captures the basic class structure implied by the
use case flows of events.
</li>

<li>
Then it is
time to study the flows of events in detail. 
</li>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Having looked at the requirements/analysis documents, you can then study the design
phase by viewing the CRC cards, the overall Class
Diagram, and the Statechart and Interaction Diagrams.  
</p>

<ul>

<li>
There is one CRC card for each class, incorporating all responsibilities of
the class arising from all of the use cases, linked to from the icon for the class
in either Class Diagram.  The CRC cards were created by "walking through" each
use case, assigning the responsibility for each task to some class.   Note that
there are CRC cards for classes that do not appear in the Analysis Class Diagram;
the need for these classes became apparent as the other cards were being created.
(This is typical; Booch suggests that the ratio of classes in a complete application
to analysis classes may be as much as 5:1; in this particular case, it is about 2:1.)
</li>

<li>
The Class Diagram pulls together all of the structural information from
the CRC Cards and shows the needed links between classes.  
Each class icon is linked to other relevant design documents, including a detailed design
for that class.
</li>

<li>
For the major controller classes, there is also a Statechart diagram depicting the
various states the corresponding object can be in.  This, too, is accessible from the
class's icon in either Class Diagram.
</li>

<li>
Finally, there is one Interaction diagram for each use case, linked to from the use
case flow of events.  This shows the objects that
work together to realize the use case, and the flow of messages between them.  This
records the same assignment of responsibilities as in the CRC cards, but in a different way 
(organized by use case, rather than by class), with additional detail.  (These, rather
than the CRC cards, were actually used when creating the detailed design.  CRC cards
are not actually a UML diagram, but are a useful tool to help in discovering the
design that does get recorded in UML Interaction diagrams.)
</li>

</ul>

<p>
In terms of the order in which these would be created, the Analysis Class Diagram and
the CRC cards would be done first, then the overall Class Diagram, and
finally the Statechart and Interaction Diagrams.
Thus, to understand the design <em>process</em>, these could be read
in the order they were created.  However, in terms of understanding the design
itself, it may be desirable to read the Class Diagram first.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
The detailed design document was developed directly from
the Interaction diagrams and Class Diagram.  The former determined what methods the
class would need, and both the former and the latter determined what attributes were
needed.  
</p>
<p>
In terms of actually writing the code, the skeletons for the various classes were created
directly from the detailed design.  The individual method bodies were fleshed out by using the
Statechart and Interaction diagrams.  Each message on the Interaction diagram becomes a line or
so of code in the implementation.  The controller classes for which a statechart was
done have a method that is structured as a finite state machine based on the statechart
(run() in ATM; performSession() in Session; performTransaction() in Transaction.) 
</p>

<p>
Although this web site shows a finished product in which
the various design documents and the code are in agreement, the reality is that the coding
process demonstrated the need
for slight changes to the various design documents, so in some cases the design documents
were modified to conform to the code, rather than vice versa.  (However, the bulk of the
design did exist before the code was written!  The idea is to use the design documents
to guide coding, not to produce design documents after the fact!) 
</p> 
</li>

<li>
<p>
Under the Quality Assurance heading, there is a link to an executable (applet) form of
the Java implementation, which you can run if you have a JDK 1.1.x (or later)
compliant browser.  Enjoy! 
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Finally, under the Maintenance heading, there is a link to a page of suggested changes.
One such change deals with implementing a stated requirement that is missing from
the design and implementation presented here.  (This would never happen in real life,
of course :-) )  Can you find the missed requirement?
Other changes have to do with adding additional
features to the system.  These make interesting exercises for the reader.
