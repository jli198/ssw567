Although you can useyour regular keyboard, it's more fun to click on the keys on the simulated ATMkeyboard as displayed.</li><li>Perform any number of transactions, using your mouse to click the keys on the simulated ATMkeyboard.  Note that the machine will simulate ejecting your card when you indicateyou do not wish to perform any more transactions (unless, of course, your card isretained due to too many invalid PINs).</li></ol></li><li>Turn off the ATM by clicking on the "OFF" button (same position as the "ON"button".  Note that you cannot turn the ATM off while in the middle of a customersession.</li><li>The entire simulation may be repeated as many times as you want, by turningthe machine ON again.</li></ol><p>For demonstration purposes, this program uses a very simple simulation of the bank, withhardwired card numbers and PIN's, etc.  The following are the available cards:</p><table width="100%"><tr><th align="left">Card Number</th><th align="left">PIN</th><th align="left">Available accounts</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>42</td><td>Checking account #1, Savings account #2</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>1234</td><td>Checking account #1, Money market account #3</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>	(Note that both cards link to the same checking account)</td></tr></table><p>All the features of the bank work - both current and available balances (initiallythe same) are maintained for each account and a $300 daily withdrawal limit per cardis enforced.</p><p>I would appreciate <a href="mailto:bjork@gordon.edu">feedback</a> about the operation and/or appearance of this appleton different platforms.
