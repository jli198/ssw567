    "To complete the assignment this week you do need to have a good grasp of the python mocking framework provided by the unittest.mock module.  As I said in the lecture, each language has it's own frameworks and their own way of doing things, and I didn't necessarily want to focus too much attention on teaching a specific technology, as that will change.  It is important to understand the basic concepts of mocking, which should be consistent across implementations.  So I hope in this note to describe the concepts, using the python mocking framework to help solidify the ideas.\n",
