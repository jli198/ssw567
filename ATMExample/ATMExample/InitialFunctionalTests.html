<title>Initial Functional Test Cases for Example ATM System</title>

</head>

<body>
<h2>Initial Functional Test Cases for Example ATM System</h2>

<p>
The following initial test cases can be identified early in the design process as a
vehicle for checking that the implementation is basically correct.  <em>No attempt has
been made at this point to do thorough testing, including all possible errors and
boundary cases.</em>  That needs to come later.  These cases represent an initial check
that the functionality specified by the use cases is present.
</p>

<p>
Some writers would argue for developing test cases like these <em>in place of</em>
use cases.  Here, they are presented as a vehicle for &quot;fleshing out&quot; the use
cases, not as a substitute for them.
